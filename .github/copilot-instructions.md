# Copilot Instructions for This Codebase

## Overview
This project currently consists of HTML files, such as `bloomberg-terminal.html` and `Untitled-1.html`. There is no detected build system, backend, or external dependencies. The workspace is minimal and primarily static.

## Key Files
- `bloomberg-terminal.html`: Main HTML file, likely the primary focus for UI or prototyping.
- `Untitled-1.html`: Additional HTML file, possibly for experiments or drafts.

## Project Structure & Conventions
- All files are at the root level; no subdirectories for assets, scripts, or styles detected.
- No JavaScript, CSS, or backend code present as of this analysis.
- No README or project documentation found.
- No custom build, test, or deployment workflows are defined.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on editing and improving the HTML files directly.
- If adding scripts or styles, consider inlining them within the HTML or create new files in the root directory.
- Use clear comments in HTML to document major sections or changes.
- If introducing new conventions (e.g., folder structure, naming), document them in this file.

## Examples
- To add a new feature, create a new HTML file or update `bloomberg-terminal.html`.
- For UI changes, edit the relevant HTML directly; no build step is required.

## Next Steps
- If the project grows, update this file to reflect new patterns, workflows, or dependencies.
- Add a README.md for broader project context if needed.
